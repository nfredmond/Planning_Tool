# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets for the TransportVoice client application.

## Required Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application
- `favicon.ico` - The favicon for the application
- `manifest.json` - The web app manifest for PWA functionality
- `robots.txt` - Instructions for web crawlers

## Images

For production, you'll need to add the following images:

- `logo192.png` - Small logo for PWA and favicons (192x192px)
- `logo512.png` - Large logo for PWA and favicons (512x512px)
- `img/hero-bg.jpg` - Background image for the hero section on the home page

Note: For development, the application uses fallback styles when these images are not available.
