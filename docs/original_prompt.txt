I want to create an open-source transportation planning community outreach mapping tool that takes peoples input on a map and provide a comment and an optional picture upload. There should be an admin that allows user admin and also AI LLM integration where I can select an LLM and API and then save it to go back and forth between ai models. I also want extensive reporting functionality. I want users to upvote or downvote user comments. Comments should be approved by the LLM. The admin should have a basemap gallery and the ability to upload multiple KMZs as layers in the admin to make the map we want per project. There should also be a create new project in the admin. Also a share to X and /or facebook on the public facing platform. Please come up with a product plan for this and also add in any awesome features you think would make it become viral in the urban planning community.EditTransportation Planning Community Outreach Tool - Product Plan
