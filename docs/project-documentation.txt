### Installation and Setup

#### Environment Configuration

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the values:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Configure your API keys and other settings in `.env.local`
4. If you encounter port conflicts, you can modify these port settings in your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   CLIENT_PORT=3001  # Change from default 3000 if port is already in use
   SERVER_PORT=5001  # Change from default 5000 if port is already in use
   MONGO_PORT=27018  # Change from default 27017 if port is already in use
   ```

#### Development Setup

For local development:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transportvoice.git
   cd transportvoice
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   # Server Configuration
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/transportvoice
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
   EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@transportvoice.org

   # Encryption (for API keys)
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
   ```

6. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:init
   ```

7. Start the development server:

   npm run client:dev
   ```

8. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Docker Deployment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transportvoice.git
   cd transportvoice
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   # MongoDB Configuration
   MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
   MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=secure_password
   MONGO_USERNAME=transportvoice
   MONGO_PASSWORD=tv-password

   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

Note: The Docker setup includes healthchecks for all services to ensure proper startup sequence. The server container will only start after the MongoDB container is healthy, and the client container will only start after the server container has started.

### Default Admin Credentials

After initialization, you can login with the following admin credentials:

- Email: `admin@transportvoice.org`

## Engagement Enhancements Module

The `engagement_enhancements.py` module provides advanced community engagement features designed to increase public participation and improve the quality of feedback in transportation projects.

### Features

#### Scenario Testing
Allows planners to create and manage multiple scenarios (alternatives) for the same project area and collect specific feedback for each option. This helps in comparing community preferences across different design proposals.

```python
# Example usage
ee = EngagementEnhancements()
ee.add_scenario("Downtown", "Transit Option A", "Increase bus frequency and add bike lanes.")
ee.add_scenario("Downtown", "Transit Option B", "Add light rail options and pedestrian zones.")
ee.compare_scenarios("Downtown")
```

#### Gamification Elements
Increases engagement through achievement-based rewards like badges. Community members can earn recognition for quality contributions or reaching participation milestones.

```python
# Example usage
ee.award_badge("user123", "Community Champion")
```

#### Virtual Community Meetings
Integrates video conferencing with interactive whiteboarding capabilities specifically designed for transportation planning meetings. This allows real-time discussions focused on project maps and plans.

```python
# Example usage
ee.setup_virtual_meeting("meeting1", "https://video-conference.example.com/meeting1")
```

#### Follow-up Engagement Loops
Automatically notifies community members when their suggestions are addressed or implemented, creating a feedback loop that demonstrates the value of participation and increases trust.

```python
# Example usage
ee.notify_follow_up("user456", "Consider more green areas.", "Approved increased park zones")
```

### Integration with Admin Dashboard
The Engagement Enhancements module is integrated with the admin dashboard, allowing project managers to configure and monitor all engagement features through a user-friendly interface.

## Deployment

### Production Considerations

1. **Security:**
   - Set strong passwords for MongoDB
   - Generate secure JWT secret keys
   - Implement proper SSL certificates
   - Review application permissions

2. **Performance:**
   - Enable caching for static assets
   - Consider implementing database indexes for large datasets
   - Optimize image uploads with compression

3. **Scalability:**
   - Implement load balancing for multiple instances
   - Set up proper monitoring and alerting
   - Consider database scaling strategies

### A2 Hosting with cPanel Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on A2 Hosting using cPanel's Git Version Control feature:

1. **Setup Repository in cPanel:**
   - Log in to your A2 Hosting cPanel
   - Navigate to "Git Version Control"
   - Create a new repository or manage an existing one
   - Set the remote URL to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/yourusername/transportvoice.git`
   - Set the branch to `main`

2. **Automated Deployment Configuration:**
   - The `.cpanel.yml` file in the repository root configures the deployment process
   - It copies files to the appropriate directories
   - Installs dependencies and builds the client application
   - Sets proper file permissions

3. **Deployment Process:**
   - After pushing changes to GitHub, go to cPanel Git Version Control
   - Navigate to your repository and click "Manage"
   - Go to the "Pull or Deploy" tab
   - Click "Deploy HEAD Commit" to deploy the latest changes

4. **Webhook Integration:**
   - For automatic deployment, set up a webhook in GitHub
   - In cPanel Git Version Control, copy the webhook URL
   - Add this URL to your GitHub repository webhooks
   - Configure to trigger on push events to the main branch
   
5. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If deployment fails, check that the `.cpanel.yml` file exists
   - Ensure there are no uncommitted changes in the repository
   - Review Apache error logs in cPanel (under "Metrics" > "Errors")

### Production Environment Variables

For production deployments, ensure you set appropriate values for:

```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGO_URI=(secure MongoDB connection string)
JWT_SECRET=(strong random string)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=(strong random string)
```
